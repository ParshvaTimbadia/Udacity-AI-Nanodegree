## Project 1: Sudoku Solver
Using constraint propagation to apply naked twins strategy in sudoku by extending the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve diagonal Sudoku puzzles.
A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell.

## Project 2: Build a Forward-Planning Agent
Combining symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then experimenting with different search algorithms and heuristics, and using the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.
