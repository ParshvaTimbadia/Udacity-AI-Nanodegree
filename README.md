# Udacity-AI-Nanodegree
Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program

## Project 1: Sudoku Solver
Extending the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve diagonal Sudoku puzzles.
A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell.
Naked Twins strategy is also implemented in the solution.
The project is done without the use of PyGame(for visualisations).
